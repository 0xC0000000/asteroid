AsteroidOS build system
=======================

[AsteroidOS](http://asteroidos.org) is a free and open-source smartwatch platform based on OpenEmbedded, libhybris and Qt5. It currently only runs on the LG G Watch.

You can fully build a flashable image from source with the following commands, but be careful it will take several hours:

    . ./prepare-build.sh
    bitbake steroid-image
